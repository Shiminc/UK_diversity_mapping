# UK diversity mapping
This is my first personal data storytelling/journalism project. For this personal project, I aims to come up with data stories while learning the best practice of information visualisation and narration. The tools I am currently using include Python and its data viz libraries including folium and altair-vega, as well as html and css to customize my page. In this repository, you can find the following information:
1. Data - All the data I used for the visualisation and analysis.
2. Charts - The json file of the charts I produced and embedded in the webpage.
3. src - The codes I wrote to process the data and produce the visualisation.
4. index.html - The html of the webpage
5. requirements - The libraries I have used for this project.
